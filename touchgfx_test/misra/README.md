# MISRA config notes

## Real vs. best-effort

- **MISRA C:2012** (`.c`/`.h`): real, via Cppcheck's free `misra.py` addon. Rule numbers
  (e.g. `misra-c2012-15.1`) are genuine.
- **MISRA C++:2008** (`.cpp`/`.hpp`): **best-effort only**, via a curated clang-tidy subset
  (`../.clang-tidy`). Not certified, no real rule numbers — no free tool provides certified
  MISRA C++ coverage (Cppcheck's MISRA C++ addon is Premium/paid; PC-lint Plus, PVS-Studio,
  Helix QAC are all paid; the archived `clang-tidy-misra` project covers ~8% and requires
  patching clang-tidy).

## Licensing

MISRA rule *text* is copyrighted by MISRA/HORIBA MIRA, not redistributed here — findings are
rule-number-only. Buying the standard gets you rule text for deviation records/audits; not
needed for the tools to run.

## Before an audit

Buy Cppcheck Premium, swap the clang-tidy pass in `scripts/lint.sh` for its real MISRA C++
addon. Everything else (exclusions, demo self-test) stays the same.

## Notes

- Cppcheck platform: `arm32-wchar_t4.xml` (bundled, cppcheck's own upstream ARM definition)
  — 32-bit int/long/pointer, **unsigned-by-default char** (real ARM EABI behavior, verified
  against arm-none-eabi-gcc's own `__CHAR_UNSIGNED__`/`__SIZEOF_WCHAR_T__` macros). Without
  this, cppcheck defaults to this dev machine's own type sizes, which can both miss real
  bugs (e.g. shift-overflow that's fine on a 64-bit host `long` but UB on a 32-bit one) and
  misjudge signedness-sensitive MISRA checks.
- Excluded dirs: `exclude-paths.txt` — vendor/generated code, skipped by every engine.
- Formatting: `scripts/format.sh check|fix [target...]` (clang-format, Allman, 4-space, CRLF
  line endings). Trailing comments use `///` and are column-aligned (clang-format's
  `AlignTrailingComments`, on by default) — matches firmware team's existing template style.
- Naming/casing: **not enforced**, deliberately. No `readability-identifier-naming` in
  `../.clang-tidy`, and MISRA C:2012 itself doesn't mandate casing (only distinctness/length,
  rules 5.1–5.9). The firmware team's own template mixes conventions (`Motor_control` vs
  `Motor_stspin250_control_on` vs CubeMX's `htim3`/`HAL_GPIO_WritePin`), so no single naming
  policy fits without constant false flags against generated code. In hand-written code, match
  the surrounding ST/HAL convention (capitalized module prefix + snake_case tail for functions,
  PascalCase params, `UPPER_SNAKE` macros) rather than the demo/ fixtures' plain snake_case.
- Pre-commit: `../.pre-commit-config.yaml` auto-formats + lints staged files; set up via
  `scripts/setup.sh` (bootstraps `pre-commit` via `uv` or `pip`).
- Windows: needs Git Bash.
- `bear` is optional on every platform, not auto-installed by `setup.sh` — it's only a
  fallback for old STM32CubeIDE versions without the native `compile_commands.json` export
  checkbox. Install it yourself (`apt`/`brew`) only if `gen_compile_commands.sh` reports no
  native export was found.
- STM32Cube VS Code extension (CMake) projects: `gen_compile_commands.sh` finds
  `build/<preset>/compile_commands.json` too (CubeMX's CMake toolchain defaults to
  `binaryDir: "${sourceDir}/build/${presetName}"`, two levels down — not the one level
  CubeIDE's managed-build export uses). Just run the CMake configure step once (any preset)
  before running `gen_compile_commands.sh`; no `bear`/CubeIDE needed for this path at all.
- Windows + WSL both installed: `.vscode/tasks.json`'s Windows overrides run
  `scripts/git-bash-resolve.cmd` rather than bare `bash` — if PATH resolves `bash` to WSL's
  launcher instead of Git Bash (common when both are present), a task looks like it's running
  forever and does nothing, since it's operating inside WSL's filesystem, not yours. The
  resolver checks known Git-for-Windows install locations directly (Program Files, per-user
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Git`, scoop) instead of trusting PATH. Installed somewhere else?
  Add a line to the `CANDIDATES[]` block at the top of that script.
- Windows PATH staleness: `setup.sh` installs tools via winget, but Windows only refreshes
  PATH for *new* processes — an already-open terminal or VSCode window won't see them.
  Close and reopen Git Bash (and restart VSCode) **before** opening the folder, so the
  folder-open "Check tools installed" task doesn't falsely report them as missing. This
  applies to STM32CubeIDE too — it's Eclipse-based and has the same stale-PATH problem
  after installing tools that shell out to the system PATH; restart CubeIDE after
  installing anything that changes it.
- Updating an installed copy: `scripts/update.sh <target-repo>` re-syncs from this repo.
  `.vscode/*.json` files deep-merge in place (dicts merge key-by-key, lists merge by
  `label`/`id`/`name` identity where present else concat-dedupe, upstream wins scalar
  conflicts — needs `python3`, already a hard dep via cppcheck's `misra.py` addon); every
  other synced file (scripts/, `.clang-tidy`, CI workflow, etc.) is just overwritten.
  `install.sh` is just this run on an empty target.
- Headers "not found" in clangd even with `compile_commands.json` present: clangd refuses
  to query an arbitrary compiler binary named in `compile_commands.json` for its implicit
  system-include paths (newlib/CMSIS headers like `stdint.h` live there) unless that binary
  is explicitly whitelisted. `.vscode/settings.json` sets
  `--query-driver=**/arm-none-eabi-*` to allow it — without this flag, clangd falls back to
  its own bundled Clang headers, which don't match the ARM toolchain's. Restart the clangd
  language server after this changes (Command Palette → `clangd: Restart language server`).
- `compile_flags.txt` is generated, not shipped (`scripts/gen_compile_flags.sh`, called by
  `setup.sh`) — gitignored, since the correct paths depend on this exact machine's ARM
  toolchain version/location. It's the fallback used before you've run
  `gen_compile_commands.sh` against a real project (or for any file that isn't in that
  project's build). If `arm-none-eabi-g++` is on PATH, it queries GCC directly for its real
  system-include paths (the C++ standard library lives in a CPU/FPU-specific multilib
  subdirectory clang can't guess); if not found, you get CPU/target flags only and standard
  headers (`<cstdint>` etc.) won't resolve until either a standalone ARM toolchain is on
  PATH and you re-run `gen_compile_flags.sh`, or you generate a real `compile_commands.json`
  (which always works, since CubeIDE's own compiler path is embedded in the real build).
- If both `compile_flags.txt` and `compile_commands.json` exist in the same directory,
  clang-tidy/clangd pick `compile_flags.txt` — verified empirically, the opposite of the
  commonly assumed precedence. `gen_compile_commands.sh` deletes `compile_flags.txt` once it
  writes a real `compile_commands.json`, so this never comes up in normal use; it only
  matters if you're debugging why lint results don't seem to reflect the real project.
- CubeIDE's native `compile_commands.json` export sets `"directory"` to the project root, but
  every `-I` flag in `"command"` is relative and was written assuming cwd = the build-config
  dir (`Debug/`) one level below root — that's where the compiler actually ran from.
  clang-tidy/clangd resolve relative `-I` paths against `"directory"` per spec, so as
  exported every relative include silently resolves one level *above* the project and never
  finds a header (verified against a real export). `gen_compile_commands.sh` patches
  `"directory"` to the real build-config folder on every copy — this is automatic, not
  something you need to touch, but explains why a hand-copied CubeIDE export (bypassing
  `gen_compile_commands.sh`) will still show nested/standard-library-style header errors.
- `cppcheck --addon=misra.py` bare-name resolution (cwd, then a folder next to cppcheck's own
  exe) can fail on Windows: winget's Cppcheck installs to `Program Files`, but `PATH` often
  resolves `cppcheck` through an App Execution Alias reparse stub, which breaks the
  exe-relative `addons/` lookup even though the real addon file is sitting right there.
  `lint.sh` resolves the real path itself (`resolve_misra_addon`, checked against common
  Linux/macOS/Windows install locations) and passes it explicitly instead of trusting the
  bare name. Some Windows cppcheck installs genuinely don't ship a working `addons/` folder at
  all (a known upstream issue) — if nothing is found locally, `lint.sh` self-heals by
  downloading `misra.py` + its `misra_9.py` dependency from cppcheck's own upstream repo into
  a gitignored `misra/vendor-addons/` cache.
- `misra.py` is itself a Python script; cppcheck spawns a python interpreter to run it, and its
  own auto-detect (bare `python3` then `python` on `PATH`) can fail inside STM32CubeIDE's
  post-build step specifically — Eclipse's spawned-process `PATH` doesn't necessarily carry the
  same `PATH` your interactive Git Bash shell has (verified against a real CubeIDE build: every
  file bailed out with `Failed to auto detect python`, meaning zero MISRA checks actually ran).
  `lint.sh` resolves a `--addon-python` interpreter itself, preferring `uv python find` — `uv`
  is already a hard dependency (it bootstraps pre-commit) and manages its own Python
  independent of system `PATH`, so it works even on a Windows machine with no bare
  `python3`/`python` on `PATH` at all.
- cppcheck's C pass extracts real `-I`/`-D` flags from `compile_commands.json` when one exists
  (one representative entry's flags, applied to every target file in a single invocation —
  STM32CubeIDE projects use one global include/define set across all project files, verified
  against a real export) instead of none at all — without this, cppcheck can't resolve a single
  one of the project's own headers (`"FreeRTOS.h"`, `"main.h"`, ...) and spams `missingInclude`
  for every file, which also fails the build since those count toward `--error-exitcode=1`.
  This does its own flag extraction rather than using cppcheck's own `--project=`/
  `--file-filter=` — that was tried first, but verified against a real STM32CubeIDE run that
  cppcheck's native Windows exe can reject every `--file-filter` with `could not find any files
  matching the filter` even when the filter path is byte-for-byte identical to the database's
  own `"file"` entry, a project-loader quirk with no visibility from outside cppcheck itself.
  Falls back to whatever `-I`/`-D` flags it can pull out of `compile_flags.txt` when there's no
  `compile_commands.json` at all, since cppcheck has no native concept of that file and errors
  on most of its other flags (`--target=`, `-mcpu=`, ...) if forwarded as-is.
- `lint.sh` exit codes: `0` clean, `1` real lint findings, `2` the toolchain itself is broken
  (e.g. `misra.py` addon not found) — kept distinct from `1` so a CubeIDE post-build failure
  caused by a misconfigured tool doesn't look identical to one caused by a real MISRA
  violation. cppcheck's own output is scanned for known config-error strings to tell them
  apart, since cppcheck returns the same exit code for both.
- `.clang-tidy`'s `HeaderFilterRegex` is `''` (clang-tidy's real default), not `'.*'` — `'.*'`
  makes clang-tidy also diagnose every transitively-included header (CMSIS, HAL, standard
  library), none of which this project owns or can fix. Empty restricts diagnostics to only
  the exact file passed on the command line; `.hpp` files are still linted since `lint.sh`
  scans them directly as their own targets.

## Showing findings in CubeIDE's own Problems view (no plugin)

Eclipse CDT has a built-in mechanism for exactly this: its GNU Error Parser scans the build
console for `file:line:col: severity: message` lines and turns them into Problems-view
markers — but only for `warning`/`error`/`note`/`info`/`remark`, not cppcheck's own
`style`/`performance`/`portability` severities (which most MISRA findings use, and would
otherwise be silently dropped). `scripts/lint.sh --cubeide` forces cppcheck's output into
`warning:` format for exactly this; clang-tidy's already matches (`WarningsAsErrors` in
`.clang-tidy` makes it print `error:`).

Setup: Project Properties → C/C++ Build → Settings → **Build Steps** tab → Post-build steps
command:
```
"${ProjDirPath}/scripts/git-bash-resolve.cmd" "${ProjDirPath}/scripts/lint.sh" --cubeide "${ProjDirPath}"
```
(Linux/macOS: skip the resolver, just `"${ProjDirPath}/scripts/lint.sh" --cubeide "${ProjDirPath}"`.)
Confirm the GNU C/C++ Error Parser is enabled under the **Error Parsers** tab (on by default
for managed-build projects). Findings then appear as build warnings/errors after every
build. Note this runs *after* compilation, so a lint finding doesn't block getting a
binary — it just flags the build with an error/warning indicator, same fail-loud behavior
as the rest of this toolchain.
